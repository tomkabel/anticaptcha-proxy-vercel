# Project Brief

This project provides a secure solution for using the Anti-Captcha API in client-side JavaScript applications running in browsers, without exposing or leaking the API key. Instead of storing the key in frontend code, it utilizes a proxy serverless function (such as Vercel, Netlify, or AWS Lambda) to handle API interactions securely on the server side.
